The issue is that calculatedAdjustedNewFhaMip hasn't been defined. You need to add a useMemo calculation for it. Here's the fix:
Add This Calculation to Your State Variables Section
Add this with your other useMemo calculations (around lines 1075-1090):
javascript// Auto-calculate Adjusted New FHA MIP (New Loan Amount × Cost Factor)
const calculatedAdjustedNewFhaMip = useMemo(() => {
  const newLoanAmount = parseInt(fhaMipNewLoanAmount.replace(/[^\d]/g, '') || '0', 10);
  const factor = parseFloat(fhaMipCostFactor || '0');
  const mip = newLoanAmount * (factor / 100);
  return mip > 0 ? Math.round(mip).toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',') : '';
}, [fhaMipNewLoanAmount, fhaMipCostFactor]);
You Also Need to Add the State Variable
If you don't already have fhaMipNewLoanAmount state, add this to your state variables (around lines 1065-1073):
javascriptconst [fhaMipNewLoanAmount, setFhaMipNewLoanAmount] = useState('');
And Add the Input Field in Your Dialog
You need to add a "New Loan Amount" field in your dialog (this should go before the "New FHA Upfront MIP Estimate" field):
jsx{/* New Loan Amount */}
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <Label htmlFor="fha-mip-new-loan-amount" className="w-48 text-left">
    New Loan Amount:
  </Label>
  <div className="flex items-center border border-input px-3 rounded-md flex-1 bg-background">
    <span className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">$</span>
    <Input
      id="fha-mip-new-loan-amount"
      type="text"
      placeholder="0"
      value={fhaMipNewLoanAmount}
      onChange={(e) => {
        const value = e.target.value.replace(/[^\d]/g, '');
        const formatted = value ? value.replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',') : '';
        setFhaMipNewLoanAmount(formatted);
      }}
      className="border-0 bg-transparent focus-visible:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-offset-0"
      data-testid="input-fha-mip-new-loan-amount"
    />
  </div>
</div>
Summary
The calculation needs:

Input: New Loan Amount (user enters this)
Input: FHA MIP Cost Factor (you already have this)
Output: Adjusted New FHA MIP = New Loan Amount × (Cost Factor / 100)

Once you add these three pieces, the green box will auto-calculate and display the result!
