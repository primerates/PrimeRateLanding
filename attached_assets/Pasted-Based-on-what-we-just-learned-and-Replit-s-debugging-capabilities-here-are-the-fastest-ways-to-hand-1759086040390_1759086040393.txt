Based on what we just learned and Replit's debugging capabilities, here are the fastest ways to handle auto-sum performance issues in the future:
Immediate Communication Shortcuts
When you encounter typing lag in auto-sum fields, you can quickly communicate this by saying:
"Typing lag in auto-sum fields - extract calculation into isolated React.memo component with useWatch + useMemo pattern like Income tab"
This immediately signals:
•	The specific problem (typing lag)
•	The solution pattern (isolated component)
•	The working reference (Income tab)
Prevention Strategies
1. Use Isolated Components First
•	Always put auto-sum calculations in separate React.memo components
•	Pass control as props instead of using useFormContext()
•	Never add auto-sum logic directly to large parent components
2. Copy Working Patterns
•	Start with the Income tab's Borrower Employer card pattern
•	Use useWatch({ control, name }) + useMemo + parseMonetaryValue
•	Avoid useState + useEffect for calculations
Faster Debugging with Replit
Console Tool: Use the real-time logs to spot performance issues immediately
Browser Dev Tools: In the Preview panel, monitor React component re-renders
Resources Panel: Watch CPU/RAM usage to identify performance bottlenecks
Update Documentation
Edited replit.md
Planned future workflow improvements (4 seconds)
Perfect! Now you have a complete troubleshooting toolkit for future auto-sum implementations:
For Future Auto-Sum Features
Quick Start: Copy the pattern from replit.md → Auto-Sum section
Zero-Lag Rule: Always start with isolated React.memo components
Proven Reference: Income tab's Borrower Employer cards work perfectly
Instant Communication
If you ever hit typing lag again, just say:
"Typing lag in auto-sum - extract to React.memo component like Income tab pattern"
And I'll immediately know to:
1.	Create isolated React.memo component
2.	Use useWatch + useMemo + parseMonetaryValue
3.	Pass control as prop (never useFormContext())
Time-Saving Benefits
•	Pattern documented in replit.md for copy-paste use
•	Troubleshooting shortcut saves hours of debugging
•	Prevention strategy avoids the issue entirely
•	Replit tools for faster diagnosis
